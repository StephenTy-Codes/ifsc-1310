    <div class="secondary"><h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2></div>
    <p>Coming into the semester having never wrote code in any meaningful way I was a little nervous. After the first few weeks, seeing how a strong foundation of HTML to build upon with CSS and eventually Javascript, things began to click, this doesn't mean it is easy by any means of course. Things I did well this semester were managing my file system, and understanding the concepts of what CSS does for HTML and vice-versa. I don't think I would do anything if I had to start over, but if I had to choose something I would probably research Javascript a bit more near the end of the semester as it seems like there is a near infinite amount to learn. Making the first version of the dragon project really opened my eyes and made me appreciate all that goes into making a website look and feel right. For the second version, I asked my wife what changes I could make to add to the experience and overall aesthetic of the site. She didn't have much to add until I brought up the idea of the hero shot rotating images. I could see how implementing JavaScript would make the site a great experience, but considering my lack of experience, I decided that the second version of the dragon site didn't need much change. With that being said, I did make an attempt at adding the rotating images and I am pretty happy with the result! </p>
    <div class="secondary"><h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2></div>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is probably the most important thing in web development because it focuses on the content. You want your content available to all users, which can be easier said than done due to the wide range of devices available. Having a solid foundation of html on your site will make all the difference in the world when it comes to your message being portrayed. When you throw in some flavor with CSS and JavaScript you can add to that foundation and make it more enjoyable, but you also add to the list of problems that could happen, especially to people on older mobile devices or browsers. </p>
