    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>Making the first version of the dragon project really opened my eyes and made me appreciate all that goes into what makes making a website look and feel right. For the second version, I asked my wife what changes I could make to add to the experience and overall aesthetic of the site. She didn't have much to add until I brought up the idea of the hero shot rotating images. I could see how learning JavaScript would make the site a great experience but for my experience level having, and having the input from my wife, I decided that the second version of the dragon site looked great, and the rotating hero shots were a nice addition. </p>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is probably the most important thing in web development because it focuses on the content. You want your content available to all users, which can be easier said than done due to the wide range of devices available. Having a solid foundation of html on your site will make all the difference in the world when it comes to your message being portrayed. When you throw in some flavor with CSS and JavaScript you can add to that foundation and make it more enjoyable, but you also add to the list of problems that could happen, especially to people on older mobile devices, or browsers. </p>
